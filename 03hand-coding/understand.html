            <h2>Why should you audit your hobbies?</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Ensure hobbies match current and future lifestyle.</dt>
                <dd>Think about your current and future lifestyle. Do your hobbies match your financial situation? Do they match your current physical condition? Will they still when you're 65? You should choose hobbies that are within your physical capabilities and budgets for money and time. If one of your hobbies is hard on the body, consider whether you're willing to dedicate time and effort to that hobby even though you likely won't be able to carry it with you through the second half of your life. If you're a broke college student, you may not want one of your hobbies to be car collection.</dd>
                <dt>Ensure your hobbies are balanced.</dt> 
                <dd>Having a balance hobby stack can lead to a more balanced life. A good place to start would be having a hobby in each of the following categories: creativity, fitness, intellectual challenge/learning, and social. You can also have hobbies that fulfill multiple of these requirements.</dd>
                <dt>Increase focus and efficiency.</dt>
                <dd>Auditing your hobbies can help you realized just how many hobbies are pulling on your time and your attention. Getting honest about which ones you should really be doing can help you allocate more time and focus to mastery of your favorite things.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h2>When should you audit your hobbies?</h2>
            <p>Consider auditing your hobbies anytime you have a major life change. Graduating High School. Getting married. Getting your first real job. Losing a job. Anytime you feel like your time and attention are spread too thin.</p> 
            <h2 id="criteria">Setting your criteria.</h2>
            <p>Take the time now to create your own criteria for what your hobbies should look like. Consider your physical ability and fitness goals, your financial situation, how important balance is to you, and how many goals if any would you like to continue pursuing later in life.</p>
