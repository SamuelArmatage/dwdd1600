            <p>As a young adult moving from a laid-back high school schedule to a much busier college life, I've had to get very serious about prioritizing how I spend my time. Much of which has, in the past, been spent pursuing a plethora of hobbies, from fly fishing to fencing, archery to Brazillian jiu jitsu, and more. While thinking about how I can streamline my life in order to dedicate sufficient time to the things I care most about, I decided that it would be wise to narrow down my hobbies to the ones that I enjoy the most. Around that same time, I was reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Galloway_(professor)" target="_blank">Scott Galloway</a>'s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Wealth-Formula-Financial-Security/dp/0593714024" target="_blank">The Algebra of Wealth</a></em> and came across his idea of being strategic while choosing your hobbies based on a variety of factors. I've been going through that process for myself and I'm now a firm believer that everyone should make a strategic effort to <strong>choose</strong> their passions. I've created this hobby guide to help people with that process.</p>
            <h2>How the Guide Works</h2>
            <p>I've broken this guide down into 3 steps.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Understand the goal:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why should you audit your hobbies?</li>
                        <li> When should you audit your hobbies?</li>
                        <li>What criteria should your hobby stack fulfill? <a href="understand.html#criteria">Create your criteria.</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Compare your current hobbies to your criteria:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do multiple hobbies fulfill that same criteria?</li>
                        <li>Are there any hobbies that can't fit into your criteria?</li>
                        <li>Determine which hobbies will be kept and which you will say goodbye to.</li>
                        <li>Determine which gaps exist in your hobby stack.</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
                <li>Fill gaps in hobby stack:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skim through relevant hobby catalogue sections, making note of hobbies that interest you.</li> 
                        <li>Choose which hobbies you will add to complete your hobby stack.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
